# SubVector Finder
A simple program written in C++ to search vectors for specific subvectors and return a vector of index values which shows where the subvectors are placed in the main vector.

**Example:**
```
main_vector = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
sub_vector  = {4, 5, 6}
index_sub  -> {3, 4, 5}
```
## Setup & Run
Compile the *SubVector_Finder.cpp* file with a C++ compiler and run the executable file.
```
g++ SubVector_Finder.cpp
```
